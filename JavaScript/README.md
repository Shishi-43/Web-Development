# Eloquent-JavaScript
This repo contains notes and worked examples I came across while reading eloquent javaSccript( 3rd edition, author: Marijn Haverbeke )

I'm using this space to:
- Practice JavaScript from the ground up
- Solidify my understanding by solving exercises
- Build small projects inspired by the book
- Track my progress over time
